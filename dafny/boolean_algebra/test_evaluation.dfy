        If you print the term itself, you'll see a lot of cruft
        inserted by the compiler, but if you peer through it all,
        you can disern the structure of the term: it's an "and"
        "box" with two smaller values inside. Each of those is in
        turn a box. The first is an "or" box with "litTrue" and
        "litFalse" inside. The second's a "not" box with "litFalse"
        inside. Values of inductively defined types often have this
        kind of nested, recursive struture. 
        
        You can also draw such a structure as a (computer sciency)"tree". Here it would have "and" at the top, with two sub-
        trees, the first an "or" tree, the second, a "not" tree. The
        children of the "or" tree would be "true" and "false", and
        of the not tree, "false".
