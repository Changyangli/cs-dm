   /*
    We define an "interpretation" that maps our
    variables to corresponding (bool) values. The
    word, "interpretation" is generally used in 
    logical discourse. In programming languages, 
    it might be called an environment. You can also
    think of it as the "memory" in which values of
    our Boolean variables will be stored.

    We represent an interpretation as a Dafny map
    from string names to Boolean values. Such a
    map is written as "map<string,bool>". When we
    need to evaluate a variable expression, we'll
    just look up the value of the variable in such
    a map. 

    To make the purpose of this particular 
    map<string, bool> clear, we give this type a
    "type synonym," namely "interp." From this point
    on, instead of writing map<string, bool> we can
    instead just write "interp".
    */

    type Binterp = map<Bvar, bool>

    /*
    We note that a map might not be "total": that
    is, it might not contain an entry for every 
    variable (Bvar) we have declared to exist. If
    we try to look up a value that is not defined
    in the map, we'll get an error. For example, if
    i is an interpetation (a map<string, bool>) and
    we try to look up the bool value for a string
    that isn't defined in the map, e.g., "FooBar",
    it won't work.

    Our solution for now will be to define a function
    that takes an interpretation and a string to look
    up and that returns the value for the string in the
    map if it's defined in the map, and that returns
    the value "false" as a default if the string is 
    not in the map. 
    
    This isn't a great design, in that a return of 
    "false" could mean one of two things: either the 
    value of the variable really is false, or it's 
    just not assigned a value in the interpretation. 
    For now, our design is good enough to illustate 
    our main points.
