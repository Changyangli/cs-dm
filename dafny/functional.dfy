    /*
    An "identity function" for values of type nat.
    Returns whatever int value you pass to it. Note:
    the body of a pure function is not sequential 
    code operating on a memory, code but simply an 
    expression that computes a desired return value. 
    
    The "function method" declaration indicates two
    things. First, the code will be written in a pure
    functional style. Second, the code can be called
    from imperative code. Dafny compiles "function 
    methods" into executable code. Code declared to
    be just a "function" in Dafny can be used in pre-
    and post-conditions and in other specifications,
    and so can be involved in verification, but such
    functions are not compiled to executable code.

     Compute the factorial of any non-negative integer.
     While you might want to think of the factorial of a
     number n as the product of the numbers from 1 to n,
     that's not perfect because we want the function to be
     defined for all natural numbers, from 0 up; and you
     can't very well define it as the product of numbers
     from 0 to n, because that would always be just zero.
     A better definition is a recursive definition. It has
     two cases: factorial of zero is one, and factorial of
     any larger number, n, is n times the factorial of the
     next smaller number, n-1. When the next smaller number
     is zero, the result is 1 and the product is then the
     product of all numbers from 1 to n. Recursion gives
     us an extremely concise way of representing functions
     such as factorial.
