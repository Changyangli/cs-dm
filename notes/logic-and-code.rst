Logic and Code
==============

We've discussed requirements, specifications, and implementations as
software artifacts serving distinct purposes. For good reasons, these
artifacts are generally written in different languages. In this unit,
we discuss these different kinds of languages---mathematical logic for
specifications and imperative languages for code---why they are used
for different purposes, the fundamental advantages and disadvantages
of each, and why modern software development requires fluence in and
tools for handling artifacts written in multiple such languages.

Imperative Implementations and Declarative Specifications
---------------------------------------------------------

The language of implementations is code in what we call an *imperative
programming language*. Examples of such languages include Python,
Java, C++, and Javascript. The most salient property of such a
language is that it is *procedural*. Programs in these languages
describe step-by-step *procedures*, in the form of sequences of
*commands*, for solving given problem instances. Commands in such
languages operate by (1) reading, computing with, and updating values
stored in a *mutable memory*, and (2) interacting with the world
outside of the computer by executing input and output (IO) commands.

The language of formal requirements and specifications, on the other
hand, is some kind of *mathematical logic*. Examples of logics that we
will study and use include *propositional* and *predicate* logic.  An
example of a kind of logic important in software development but that
we will not study in this class is *temporal logic.*

For purposes of software specification, the most salient property of
such a logical language is that it is *declarative*.  Expressions in
logic will state *what* properties or relationships hold in a given
situation, particularly how results must relate to inputs, without
providing executable, step-by-step procedures describing *how* to
actually compute such relationships.

To make the difference between procedural and declarative styles of
description clear, consider the problem of computing the square root
of a given non-negative number, *x*. We can *specify* the answer in a
clear and precise mathematical logical style by simply stating that,
for any given non-negative number *x*, we require a value, *y*, such
that *y^2 = x*. We can write this mathematically as *for all x >= 0,
sqrt(x) = y | y^2 = x*. In English, we'd pronounce this formula as, "
for any non-negative value, *x*, a square root of *x* is a value *y*
such that *y* squared is equal to *x*." We now have a *declarative
specification* of the desired relationship between *x* and *y* that a
program for computing square roots must compute. What we don't have,
however, is a step-by-step *procedure* for computing this relation by
finding a satisfactory value of *y* given any *x*). You can't just run
a specification written in the language of mathematical logic.

The solution is to shift from a specification to an implementation
language: from mathematical logic as a specification language to an
imperative programming language in which we can write code that runs.
And in this implementation language, we must then craft a step-by-step
procedures that when evaluted actually computes the results we seek.

Here's an example of a program in the imperative language, Python, for
computing positive square roots of non-negative numbers using Newton's
method.

    def sqrt(x):
        """for x>=0, return non-negative y such that y^2 = x"""
        estimate = x/2
        while True:
            newestimate = ((estimate+(x/estimate))/2)
            if newestimate == estimate:
                break
            estimate = newestimate
        return estimate

This procedure repeatedly updating the values stored at two locations
in memory, referred to by variables, *estimate* and *newestimate*. The
procedure repeats the update process until the procedure *converges*
on the desired answer, which occurs when the values become equal. The
answer is then returned as the desired result.

Note that, following good programming style, in precise English we
included the specification of the procedure as a document string.
There are several deep problems with this approach. First, as we've
discussed, natural language is subject to ambiguity, inconsistency,
and incompleteness. Second, because the document string is really
just a comment, there's no way to mechanically assess consistency
between the code and such an *informal* specification. Third, in
practice, code evolves, and even if a given procedure initially
consistent with a specification given in a comment, it can become
inconsistent with the documented specification over time.


Integrating Formal Specification with Imperative Programming
------------------------------------------------------------

An important approach to solving such problems is to enable the
integration of *formal* specifications with imperative programs,
including mechansims for checking the consistency of code with given
formal specifications. Dafny is a software development tooset that
provides such a capability. We will explore this idea both to give a
sense of the current state of the art in program verification and
to explain why it's important for a computer scientist today to
have a substantial understanding of logic and proofs.

Why Not a Single Language for both Programming and Specification?
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The dichotomy between specification logic and implementation code
raises an important question? Why not just design a single language
that's good for both?

The answer is that there are fundamental tradeoffs in language design.
What we see is that mathematical logic is highly *expressive*, which
is to say that this language can be used so say very clearly *what*
we want. On the other hand, it's hard in this language to say *how*
to get it. In practice, mathematical logic is clear but can't be run,
at least not efficiently. On the other hand, imperative code states
*how* a computation is to be carried out, but code generally doesn't
make clear *what* it's computing.

We are thus driven to a situation in which we have to express what
we want and how to get it in different languages. This situation then
creates a new problem: how do we know that *how* a program computes
achieves *what* it's intended to achieve? This is the problem of
*verification*. Have we built a given program right, relative to its
given specification? 

Tools such as TLA+, Dafny, and others of this variety give us a
way not only to express formal specifications and imperative code
in a unified way (albeit in different sub-languages), but also
automated methods for *attempting to* verify that given code
satisfies given specifications.

To understand how to use such cutting-edge, state-of-the-art
software development tools and methods, one must understand not
only the language of code, but the language of mathematical logic,
including set and type theory, and what it means to *prove* that
a program satisfies its specification. One must understand logic
and proofs. Herein lies the deep relevance of logic and proofs
to practicing software professionals (as opposed to mere hackers
who have taken a few programming courses and written a bunch of
imperative code).
