One way
to defineand (3) a set of *inference* rules that define ways that one
can transform one set of expressions (premises) into another (a
conclusion) in such a manner that whenver all the premises are true,
the conclusion will be, too.

Why would anyone care about rules for transforming expressions in
abstract languages? Well, it turns out that *syntactic* reasoning is
pretty useful. The idea is that we represent a real-world phenomenon
symbolically, in such a language, so the abstract sentence means
something in the real world.

Now comes the key idea: if we imbue mathematical expressions with
real-world meanings and then transform these expression in accordance
with valid rules for acceptable transformations of such expressions,
then the resulting expressions will also be meaningful.

A logic, then, is basically a formal language, one that defines a set
of well formed expressions, and that provides a set of *inference*
rules for taking a set of expressions as premises and deriving another
one as a consequence. Mathematical logic allows us to replace human
mental reasoning with the mechanical *transformation of symbolic
expressions*.
