<h1>5. Formal Verification of Imperative Programs<a class="headerlink" href="#formal-verification-of-imperative-programs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>To get a clearer sense of the potential differences in performance
between a pure functional program and an imperative program that
compute the same function, consider our recursive definition of the
Fibonacci function.</p>
<p>We start off knowing that if the argument to the function, <em>n</em>, is <em>0</em>
or <em>1</em>, the value of the function for that <em>n</em> is just <em>n</em> itself.  In
other words, the sequence, <em>fib(i)</em> of <em>Fibonacci numbers indexed by
i</em>, starts with, <img class="math" src="_images/math/d6d348c9fec97ea8bbe7cf69259bfbeda3f0a86d.png" alt="[0, 1, \ldots ]"/>.  For any <em>n &gt;= 2</em>, <em>fib(n)</em>,
is the sum of the previous two values.  To compute the <em>n’th (n &gt;= 2)</em>
Fibonacci number, we can thus start with the first two, sum them up to
get the next one, then iterate this process, computing the next value
on each iteration, until we’ve got the result.</p>
<p>Footnote: by convention we index sequences starating at zero rather
than one. The first element in such a sequence thus has index <em>0</em>, the
second has index <em>1</em>, and the <em>n’th</em> has index <em>n - 1</em>. For example,
<em>fib(6)</em> refers to the <em>7th</em> Fibonacci number. You should get used to
thinking in terms of zero-indexed sequences.</p>
<p>Now consider our recursive definition, <em>fib(n)</em>. It’s <em>pure math</em>:
concise, precise, elegant.  And because we’ve written it in a
functional language, we can even run it. However, it might not give us
the performance we require. An imperative program, by constrast, is
<em>code</em>. It’s cryptic but it can be very efficient when run.</p>
<p>To get a sense of performance diferences, consider the evaluation of
each of two programs to compute <em>fib(5)</em>: our functional program and
an imperative one that we will develop in this chapter.</p>
<p>Consider the imperative program. If the argument, <em>n</em>, is either zero
or one, the answer is just returned. If <em>n &gt;= 2</em> an answer has to be
computed. In this case, the program will repeatedly add together the
previous two values of the function, starting with <em>0</em> and <em>1</em>, until
it computes the result for <em>n</em>.  The program returns that value.</p>
<p>For a given value of <em>n</em>, what is the cost of computing an answer?
The cost will be dominated by the work done inside the loop body; and
on each iteration of the loop, a fixed amount of work is done; so it’s
not a bad idea to use the number of loop body executions as a measure
of the cost of computing an answer for an argument, <em>n</em>.</p>
<p>So, what does it cost to compute <em>fib(5)</em>? Well, we need to execute
the loop body to compute <em>fib(i)</em> for values of <em>i</em> of <em>2, 3, 4,</em> and
<em>5</em>. It thus takes <em>4</em> loop body iterations to compute <em>fib(5)</em>. To
compute the 10th element requires that the loop body execute for <em>i</em>
in the range of <em>[2, 3, …, 10]</em>. That’s nine iterations.  It’s easy
to see that for any value of <em>n</em>, the cost to compute <em>fib(n)</em> will be
<em>n-1</em> loop body iterations. We can compute the <em>100,000th</em> Fibonacci
number by running a simple loop body <em>about</em> that many times. On a
modern computer, the computation will be completed very quickly.</p>
<p>The functional program, on the other hand, is evaluated by repeated
evaluation of nested recursive function applications until base cases
are reached.  Let’s think about the cost of evaluation for increasing
values of <em>n</em> and try to see a pattern. We’ll measure computational
complexity now in terms of the number of function evaluations (rather
than loop bodies executed) required to produce a final answer.</p>
<p>To compute <em>fib(0)</em> or <em>fib(1)</em> requires just <em>1</em> function evaluation
(the first and only call to the function), as these are base cases
requiring no further recursion. To compute <em>fib(2)</em> however requires
<em>3</em> evalations of <em>fib</em>: one for each of <em>fib(1)</em> and <em>fib(0)</em> plus
the evaluation of the top-level function. The relationship between <em>n</em>
and the number of function evaluations currently looks like this:
<img class="math" src="_images/math/4be24e711a64e67912a041b077bec55122aa69cc.png" alt="\{ (0,1), (1,1), (2,3), ... \}."/> The first element of each pair
is <em>n</em> and the second element is the cost to compute <em>fib(n)</em>.</p>
<p>What about when <em>n</em> is <em>3</em>?  Computing this requires answers for
<em>fib(2)</em>, which by the resuts we just computed costs <em>3</em> evaluations,
and for <em>fib(1)</em>, which costs <em>1</em>, for a total of <em>5</em> evaluations
including the top-level evaluation. Computing <em>fib(4)</em> requires that
we compute <em>fib(3)</em> and <em>fib(2)</em>, costing <em>5 + 3</em>, or <em>8</em> evaluations,
plus the original, top-level call, for a total of 9. For <em>fib(5)</em> we
need <em>9</em> + <em>5</em>, or <em>14</em> plus one more, making <em>15</em> evaluations.  The
relation of cost to <em>n</em> (the problem size) is now like this: <img class="math" src="_images/math/885d0a047df304051a1baadee9f89870d86db99a.png" alt="\{
(0,1), (1,1), (2,3), (3,5), (4,9), (5, 15), ... \}."/></p>
<p>In general, the number of evaluations needed to evaluate <em>fib(i+1)</em> is
the sum of the numbers required to evaluate <em>fib(i)</em> plus the number
to evaluate <em>fib(i-1)</em> plus <em>1.</em> If we use <em>C</em> to represent the cost
function, then we could say, <img class="math" src="_images/math/e49ab712522c24e69d5c1c91f3b5fcdecd6d2b36.png" alt="C(n) = C(n-1) + C(n-2) + 1"/>. This
kind of function is called a recurrence relation, and there are clever
ways to solve such functions to determine what function <em>C</em> me be. Of
course we can also write a recursive function to compute <em>C(n)</em>, if
we need only to compute it for relatively small values of <em>n</em>.</p>
<p>Now that we have the formula, we can quickly compute the costs to
compute <em>fib(n)</em> for numerous values of <em>n</em>. The number of evaluations
needed to compute <em>fib(6)</em> is <em>15 + 9 + 1</em>, i.e., 25. For <em>fib(7)</em>
it’s <em>41</em>.  For <em>fib(8), *67</em>; for <em>fib(9), 109</em>; for <em>fib(10), 177</em>;
and for <em>fib(11), 286</em> function evaluations.</p>
<p>One thing is clear: The cost to compute the <em>n’th</em> Fibonacci number,
as measured by the number of function evaluations, using our beautiful
functional program, is growing much more quickly than <em>n</em> itself, and
indeed it is growing faster and faster as <em>n</em> increases. We would say
the cost is <em>super-linear</em>, whereas with our imperative program, the
number of loop body interations grows <em>linearly</em> in <em>n</em>.</p>
<p>How exactly does the cost of the pure functional program compare? One
thing to notice is that the cost of computing a Fibonacci element with
our functional program is related to the Fibonacci sequence itself!
The first two values in the <em>cost</em> sequence are <em>1</em> and <em>1</em>, and each
subsequence element is the sum of the previous two <em>plus 1</em>.  It’s not
exactly the Fibonacci sequence, but it turns out to grow at a very
similar rate. The Fibonacci sequence, thus also the cost of computing
it recursively, grows at what turns out to be a rate <em>exponential</em> in
<em>n</em>, with an exponent of about <em>1.6</em>. Increasing <em>n</em> by <em>1</em> doesn’t
just add a little to the cost; it almost doubles it (multiplying it by
a factor of <em>1.6</em>).</p>
<p>No matter how small the exponent, exponential functions eventually
grow very large very quickly. In fact, in the limit, any exponential
function (with any exponent greater than one) grows faster than any
polynomial function no matter how high in rank and no matter how large
its coefficients are. The exponential-in-<em>n</em> cost of our beautiful but
inefficient functional program grows far faster than the cost of our
ugly but efficient imperative program as we increase <em>n</em>.  For any
even modestly large value of <em>n</em> (e.g., greater than 50 or so), it
will be impractical to use the pure functional program, whereas the
imperative program will run quickly for values of <em>n</em> in the millions.
What eventually slows it down is not the number of additions that it
has to do but the sizes of the numbers that it has to add.</p>
<p>You can already see that the cost to compute <em>fib(n)</em> recursively for
values of <em>n</em> larger than just ten or so is much greater than the cost
to compute it iteratively. Our mathematical/functional definition is
clear but inefficient. The imperative program is efficient, but not at
all transparent as to its function. We need the latter program for
practical computation. But how do we ensure that hard to understand
imperative code implements the same function that we expressed so
elegantly in mathematical logic?</p>
<p>We address such problems by combining a few ideas. First, we use
logic, including functional programming, to express <em>declarative</em>
specifications that precisely define <em>what</em> a given imperative program
must do, and in particular what results it must return as a function
of the arguements it received, without saying how the computation
should be done.</p>
<p>We can use functions defined in the pure functional programming style
as parts of specifications, e.g., as giving a mathematical definition
of the <em>factorial</em> function that an imperative program will then have
to implement.</p>
<p>Second, we implement the specified program in an imperative language
in a way that supports logical reasoning about its behavior. For
example, we have to specify not only the desired relationship between
argument and result values, but also how loops are designed to work in
our code; and we need to design loops in ways that make it easier to
explain in formal logic how they do what they are meant to do.</p>
<p>Finally, we use logical proofs to <em>verify</em> that the program satisifies
its specification. Later in this course, we’ll see how to produce
those proofs ourselves. For now we’ll be satisfied to let Dafny
generate them for us!</p>
<p>We develop these idea in this chapter. First we explain how formal
specifications in mathematical logic for imperative programs are often
organized. Next we explore how writing imperative programs without the
benefits of specification languages and verifications tools can make
it hard to spot bugs in code. Next we enhance our implementation of
the factorial function with specifications, show how Dafny flags the
bug, and fix out program. Doing this requires that we deepen the way
we understand loops. We end with a detailed presentation of the design
and verification of an imperative program to compute elements in the
Fibonacci sequence. Given any natural number <em>n</em>, our program must
return the value of <em>fib(n)</em>, but it must also do it efficiently.  The
careful design of a loop is once again the heart of the problem.  We
will see how Dafny can help us to reason rigorously about loops, and
that, with just a bit of help, it can reason about them for us.</p>
<div class="section" id="logical-specification">
<h2>Logical Specification<a class="headerlink" href="#logical-specification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First, we use mathematical logic to <em>declaratively specify</em> properties
of the behaviors that we require of programs written in <em>imperative</em>
languages. For example, we might require that, when given <em>any</em> natural
number, <em>n</em>, a program compute and return the value of the <em>factorial</em>
of <em>n</em>, the mathematical definition of which we’ve given as <em>fact(n)</em>.</p>
<p>Specifications about required relationships between argument values
and return results are especially important. They specify <em>what</em> a
program must compute without specifying how. Specifications are thus
<em>abstract</em>: they omit <em>implementation details</em>, leaving it to the
programmer to decide how best to <em>refine</em> the specification into a
working imperative program.</p>
<p>For example we might specify that a program (1) must accept any
integer valued argument greater than or equal to zero (a piece of a
specification that we call a <em>precondition</em>), and (2) that as long as
the precondition holds, then it must return the factorial of the given
argument value (a <em>postcondition</em>).</p>
<p>In purely mathematical terms, a specification of this kind defines a
<em>binary relation</em> between argument and return values, and imposes on
the program a requirement that whenever it is given the first value in
such a pair, it must compute a second value so that the pair,
<img class="math" src="_images/math/bddd3d2fcb301909d7a30a542aed27eb9c6200dd.png" alt="(first value, second value)"/>, is in the specified relation.</p>
<p>A binary relation in ordinary mathematics is just a set of pairs of
values. A function is a special binary relation with at most one pair
with a given first value. A function is said to be a <em>single-valued</em>
relation.</p>
<p>For example, pairs of non-negative integers in the relation that
constitutes the factorial function include <img class="math" src="_images/math/ae62edf814c717fd922732ed256516f6009975b7.png" alt="(0,1), (1,1), (2,2),
(3,6), (4,24)"/> and <img class="math" src="_images/math/0f4f7855d834c15ad6f85cc5827f03a4962d7578.png" alt="(5,120)"/>, but not <img class="math" src="_images/math/c2f82a5bbb7c3901dbbe16f0095f1d4f5a18ded8.png" alt="(5,25)"/>. Some of
the pairs in the relation defining the Fibonacci function are
<img class="math" src="_images/math/acdc60ccbd22cdd08adb564629e04b8e0e63116a.png" alt="\{ (0,0), (1,1), (2,1), (3,2), (5,3), (6,5), \ldots"/>. These
relations are also <em>functions</em> because there is <em>at most</em> one pair
with a given first element. The functions are also said to be <em>total</em>
because for <em>every</em> natural number, there is a pair with that number
as its first element.</p>
<p>On the other hand, square root is a <em>relation</em> on the real numbers but
not a <em>function</em>, because it is not singled valued. Both <img class="math" src="_images/math/1b7acb805a656ce4ef94682e2801da6877ec5377.png" alt="(4,2)"/>
and <img class="math" src="_images/math/d07699891d863d384e38bd636bdd5b9acbb15e7a.png" alt="(4,-2)"/>, distinct pairs with the same first element are
both in the relation. That is because both <em>2</em> and <em>-2</em> are square
roots of <em>4</em>. We also note that the square root relation <em>on the real
numbers</em> is <em>partial</em> rather than total, in that it is not defined for
some elements of the real numbers (for any that are negative).  The
<em>non-negative square root</em> relation, on the other hand, is a function,
comprising only those pairs in the square root relation where both
elements are non-negative. It includes the pair, <img class="math" src="_images/math/1b7acb805a656ce4ef94682e2801da6877ec5377.png" alt="(4,2)"/> but not
<img class="math" src="_images/math/d07699891d863d384e38bd636bdd5b9acbb15e7a.png" alt="(4,-2)"/>. Viewed as a relation on the <em>non-negative</em> reals, it
is also a total function.</p>
<p>We could re-formulate the square root <em>relation</em> as a <em>function</em> in a
different way: by viewing it as a relation that associates with each
non-negative integer the single <em>set</em> of its square roots. The pair
<img class="math" src="_images/math/7be00c356e44a98838dccb8316098b269b5f09ee.png" alt="(4, \{2, -2\}"/> is in this relation, for example. The relation
is now also a function in that there is only one such pair with a
given first element. We could even extend the relation to negative
values by returning an empty set as the result of the application
of the function to a negative number.</p>
<p>Now it should be clear when we say colloquially that a program
<em>computes a function or a relation</em>. Whenever it is given a valid
argument representing the <em>first</em> value of a pair in the relation, it
computes a <em>second</em> value such that the pair, <img class="math" src="_images/math/f740fbbb0fac5ec5c0233d4402773184a07ddd90.png" alt="(first, second)"/>
is in the given relation. When we say, for example, that a program
<em>computes the factorial function</em>, we mean that if we give it a
non-negative number, <em>n</em>, it returns a number <em>m</em> such that the pair
<em>(n,m)</em> is <em>in</em> the relation. And for <em>(n,m)</em> to be in the relation it
must be that <img class="math" src="_images/math/ecefb159f55afb2d10579e24bafdc9448c0a0090.png" alt="m = fact(n)"/>. Given, <em>n</em>, such a program thus has
to return <img class="math" src="_images/math/81d4171a788af9ec16c0d560ce8574dbc60fd5da.png" alt="fact(n)"/>. A program that computes a <em>function</em> is
deterministic, in the sense that it can return at most one result:
because there is at most one result.</p>

<div class="section" id="rigorous-implementation">
<h2>Rigorous Implementation<a class="headerlink" href="#rigorous-implementation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Having written a formal specification of the required <em>input-output</em>
behavior of a program, we next write imperative code in a manner, and
in a language, that supports the use of formal logic to <em>reason</em> about
whether the program refines (implements) its formal specification. One
can use formal specifications when programming in any language, but it
helps greatly if the language has strong, static type checking. It is
even better if the language supports formal specification and logical
reasoning mechanisms right alongside of its imperative and functional
programming capabilities. Dafny is such a language and system. It is
not just a language, but a verifier.</p>
<p>In addition to choosing a language with features that help to support
formal reasoning, we sometimes also aim to write imperative code in a
way that makes it easier to reason about formally. As we’ll see below,
for example, the way that we write our while loops can make it easier
or harder to reason about their correctness. Even whether we iterate
from zero up to <em>n</em> or from <em>n</em> down to zero can affect the difficulty
of writing specification elements for a program.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="formal-verification">
<h2>Formal Verification<a class="headerlink" href="#formal-verification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The aim of formal verification is to deduce (to use deductive logic to
<em>prove</em>) that, as written, a program satisfies its specification.  In
more detail, if we’re given a program, <em>C</em> with a precondition, <em>P</em>,
and a postcondition <em>Q</em>, we want a proof that verifies that if <em>C</em> is
started in a state that satisfies <em>P</em> and if it terminates (doesn’t go
into an infinite loop), that it ends in a state that satisfies <em>Q</em>. We
call this property <em>partial correctness</em>.</p>
<p>We write the proposition that <em>C</em> is partially correct (that if it’s
started in a state that satisfies the assertion, <em>P</em>, and that if it
terminates, then it will do so in a state that satisfies assertion
<em>Q</em>) as <img class="math" src="_images/math/1005427c41bd16605ea373e0571bc699d4bca2fc.png" alt="P {C} Q."/> This is a so-called <em>Hoare triple</em>, named
after the famous computer scientist, Sir Anthony (Tony) Hoare. It is
nothing other than a proposition that claims that <em>C</em> satisfies its
<em>pre-condition/post-condition</em> specification.</p>
<p>In addition to a proof of partial correctness, we usually do want to
know that a program also does always terminate. When we have a proof
of both <img class="math" src="_images/math/4da94627e9da2ba39eb6a9489f35991358b6d425.png" alt="P \{C\} Q"/> and that the program always terminates, then
we have a proof of <em>total correctness</em>. Dafny is a programming system
that allows us to specify <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> and it then formally, and to a
considerable extent automatically, verifies both <cite>P {C} Q</cite> and
termination.  That is, Dafny produces proofs of total correctness.</p>
<p>It is important to bear in mind that a proof that a program refines
(implements) its formal specification does not necessarily mean that
it is fit for its intended purpose! If the specification is wrong,
then all bets are off, even if the program is correct relative to its
specification.  The problem of <em>validating</em> specification againts
real-world needs is separate from that of <em>verifying</em> that a given
program implements its specification correctly. Formal methods can
help here, as well, by verifying that <em>specifications</em> have certain
desired properties, but formal validation of specifications is not
our main concern at the moment.</p>

<div class="section" id="an-implementation-of-the-factorial-function">
<h2>An Implementation of the Factorial Function<a class="headerlink" href="#an-implementation-of-the-factorial-function" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>So far the material in this chapter has been pretty abstract. Now
we’ll see what it means in practice. To start, let’s consider an
ordinary imperative program, as you might have written in Python or
Java, for computing the factorial function. The name of the function
is the only indication of the intended behavior of this program. There
is no documented specification. The program takes an argument of type
nat (which guarantees that the argument has the property of being
non-negative). It then returns a nat which the programmer implicitly
claims (given the function name) is the factorial of the argument.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>method factorial(n: nat) returns (f: nat)
{
    if (n == 0)
    {
        return 1;
    }
    var t: nat := n;
    var a: nat := 1;
    while (t !=  0)
    {
        a := a * n;
        t := t - 1;
    }
    f := a;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Sadly, this program contains a bug. Try to find it. Reason about the
behavior of the program when the argument is 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.  Does it
always compute the right result? Where is the bug? What is wrong? And
how could this logical error have been detected automatically?</p>
<p>A key problem is that the program lacks a precise specification. The
program does <em>something</em>, taking a nat and possibly returning a <em>nat</em>
(unless it goes into an infinite loop) but there’s no way to analyze
its correctness in the absence of a specification that defines what
it even means to be correct.</p>
<p>Now let’s see what happens when we add a formal specification.  The
only precondition here, that <em>n &gt;= 0</em>, will continue to be expressed
by the <em>type</em> of the argument, <em>n</em>, being <em>nat</em>. However, we have now
added a postcondition that requires the return result be the factorial
of <em>n</em>, as defined by our functional program!  What we assert with the
postcondition is that the imperative program computes the factorial
function as it is defined in pure (albeit runnable) mathematics.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>method factorial(n: nat) returns (f: nat)
    ensures f == fact(n)
{
    if (n == 0)
    {
        return 1;
    }
    var t := n;
    var a := 1;
    while (t !=  0)
    {
        a := a * n;
        t := t - 1;
    }
    return a;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Dafny now reports that it cannot guarantee—formally prove to
itself—that the <em>postcondition</em> is guaranteed to hold. Generating
proofs is hard, not only for people but also for machines. In fact,
one of seminal results of 20th century mathematical logic was to prove
that there is no general-purpose algorithm for proving propositions in
mathematical logic. That’s good news for mathematicians!  If this
weren’t true, we wouldn’t need them!</p>
<p>So, the best that a machine can do is to try to find a proof for any
given proposition. Sometimes proofs are easy to generate. For example,
it’s easy to prove <em>1 = 1</em> by the <em>reflexive</em> propery of equality.
Other propositions can be hard to prove. Proving that programs in
imperative languages satisfy declarative specifications can be hard.</p>
<p>When Dafny fails to verify a program (find a proof that it satisfies
its specification), there is one of two reasons. Either the program
really does fail to satisfy its specification; or the program is good
but Dafny does not have enough information to know how to prove it.</p>
<p>With the preceding program, the postcondition really isn’t satisfied
due to the bug in the program. But even if the program were correct,
Dafny would need a little more information than is given in this code
to prove it. In particular, Dafny would need a litte more information
about how the while loop behaves. It turns out that providing extra
information about while loops is where much of the difficulty lies.
So let’s see how to get a program with a proof of correctness.</p>

<h2>A Verified Implementation of the Factorial Function<a class="headerlink" href="#a-verified-implementation-of-the-factorial-function" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here’s verified imperative program for computing factorial. We start
by documenting the overall program specification.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>method verified_factorial(n: nat) returns (f: nat)
    ensures f == fact(n)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now for the body of the method. First, if we’re looking at the case
where <em>n==0</em> we just return the right answer immediately. There is
no need for any further computation.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>if (n == 0)
{
    return 1;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The rest of the code handles the case where <em>n &gt; 1</em>. At this point in
the program execution, we believe that <em>n</em> must be greater than zero,
as we would have just returned if it were zero, and it can’t be
negative because its type is <em>nat</em>. We can nevertheless formally
assert (write a proposition about the state of the program) that <em>n</em>
is greater than zero. Dafny will try to (and here will successfully)
verify that the assertion is true at this point in the program, no
matter what path through conditionals, while loops, and sequences of
commands the program took to get here.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert n &gt; 0;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Strategy: use a while loop to compute the answer. We can do this by
using a variable, a, to hold a “partial factorial value” in the form
of a product of the numbers from n down to a loop index, “i,” that we
start at n and decrement down, terminating the loop when <em>n==0</em>. At
each point just before, during, and right after the loop, <em>a</em> is a
product of the numbers from <em>n</em> down to <em>i</em>, and the value of <em>i</em>
represents how much of this product-computing work remains to be
done. So, for example, if we’re computing factorial(10) and a holds
the value <em>10 * 9</em>, then <em>i</em> must be <em>8</em> because the task of
multiplying <em>a</em> by the factors from <em>8</em> down to <em>1</em> remains to be
done. A critical “invariant” then is that if you multiply <em>a</em> by the
factorial of <em>i</em> you get the final answer, the factorial of <em>n</em>.
And in particular, when <em>i</em> gets down to <em>0</em>, <em>a</em> must contain the
final result, because <em>a * fact(0)</em> will then equal <em>fact(n)</em> and
<em>fact(0)</em> is just <em>1</em>, so <em>a</em> must equal <em>fact(n)</em>. This is how we
design loops so that we can be confident that they do what we want
tem to do.</p>
<p>Step 1. Set up state for the loop to work. We first initializie a := 1
and i := n and check that the invariant holds. Note that we are using
our pure functional math-like definition of fact as a <em>specification</em>
of the factorial function we’re implementing.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var i: nat := n;    // nat type of i explicit
var a := 1;         // can let Dafny infer it
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In Dafny, we can use matnematical logic to express what must be true
at any given point in the execution of a program in the form of an
“assertion.” Here we assert that our loop invariant holds. The Dafny
verifier tries to prove that the assertion is a true propsition about
the state of the program when control reaches this point in the
execution of this program.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert a * fact(i) == fact(n); // &quot;invariant&quot;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Step 2: Now evaluate the loop to get the answer. To evaluate a loop,
first, evaluate the loop condition (i &gt; 0).Then , if the result is
false, terminate the loop. Otherwise, evaluate the loop body, then
iterate (run the loop again, starting by evaluating the loop
condition).</p>
<p>Note that we can deduce that the loop body is going to execute at
least once. It will run if i &gt; 0. What is i? We initialized it to n
and haven’t change it since then so it must still be equal to n. Do we
know that n is greater than 0? We do, because (1) it can’t be negative
owning to its type, and (2) it can’t be 0 because if it were 0 the
program would already have returned. But we can now do better than
just reasoning in our heads; we can use logic to express what we
believe to be true and let Dafny try to check it for us automatically.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert i &gt; 0;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Let’s just think briefly about cases. We know i can’t be zero. It
could be one. If it’s one, then the loop body will run. The loop body
will run. a, which starts at 1, will be multiplied by i, which is 1,
then i will be decremented.  It will have the value 0 and the loop
will not run again, leaving a with the value 1, which is the right
answer. So, okay, let’s run the loop.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>while (i &gt;  0)
    invariant 0 &lt;= i &lt;= n
    invariant fact(n) == a * fact(i)
{
    a := a * i;
    i := i - 1;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>At this point, we know that the loop condition is false. In English,
we’d say it is no longer true that i is greater than zero.” We can do
better that saying this in natural language then forgetting it. We can
use formal logic to formalize and document our belief and if we do
this then Dafny pays us well for our effort by checking that our
assertion is true.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert !(i &gt; 0);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can also have Dafny check that our loop invariant still holds.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert a * fact(i) == fact(n);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>And now comes the most crucial step of all in our reasoning. We can
deduce that a now holds the correct answer. That this is so follows
from the conjunction of the two assertions we just made. First, that
<em>i</em> is not greater than <em>0</em> and given that its type is <em>nat</em>, the only
possible value it can have now is <em>0</em>. That’s what we’d expect, as it
is the condition on which the loop terminates (which it just did!) But
better than just saying it, let us also formalize, document, and check
it.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert i == 0;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now it’s easy to see. No matter what value <em>i</em> has, we know that
<img class="math" src="_images/math/ad82ca55b2161087ebbfa94fcea97fb5a09997cb.png" alt="a * fact(i) == fact(n),"/> and we know that <em>i == 0</em>, so it must
be that <img class="math" src="_images/math/2c1b4ee1cff93f95564d5e3456181548807c9e50.png" alt="a * fact(0) == fact(n),"/> and fact(0) is <em>1</em> (from its
mathematical definition), so it must be that <em>a= fact(n)</em>. And Dafny
confirms it!</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert a == fact(n);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We thus have the answer we need to return.  Dafny verifies that our
program satisfies its formal specification. We no longer have to
pray. We <em>know</em> that our program is right and Dafny confirms our
belief.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>return a;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Mathematical logic is to software as the calculus is to physics and
engineering.  It’s not just an academic curiosity. It is a critical
intellectual tool, inceasingly used for precise specification and
semi-automated reasoning about and verification of real programs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-verified-implementation-of-the-fibonacci-function">
<h2>A Verified Implementation of the Fibonacci Function<a class="headerlink" href="#a-verified-implementation-of-the-fibonacci-function" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Similarly, here an imperative implementation of the fibonacci
function, without a spec.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>method fibonacci(n: nat) returns (r: nat)
    ensures r == fib(n)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now for the body. First we represent values for the two
cases where the result requires no further computation.
Initially, <em>fib0</em> will store the value of <em>fib(0)</em> and
<em>fib1</em> will store the value of <em>fib(1)</em>.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var fib0, fib1 := 0, 1; //parallel assmt
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Next, we test to see if either of these cases applies,
and if so we just return the appropriate result.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>if (n == 0) { return fib0; }
if (n == 1) { return fib1; }
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>At this point, we know something more about the state of the program
than was the case when we started. We can deduce, which is to say that
we know, that <em>n</em> has to be greater than or equal to <em>2</em>. This is
because it initially had to be greater than or equal to zero due to
its type, and then we would already have returned if it were <em>0</em> or
<em>1</em>, to it must now be <em>2</em> or greater. We can document the belief
that the current state of the program has to property that the value
of the variable <em>n</em> is greater than or equal to <em>2</em>, and Dafny will
verify this assertion for us.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert n &gt;= 2;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So now we have to deal with the case where <em>n &gt;= 2</em>. Our strategy for
computing <em>fib(n)</em> in this case is to use a while loop with an index
<em>i</em>.  Our design will be based on the idea that at the beginning and
end of each loop iteration (we are currently at the beginning), we
will have computed <em>fib(i)</em> and that its value is stored in
<em>fib1</em>. We’ve already assigned the value of <em>fib(0)</em> to <em>fib0</em>, and
<em>fib(1)</em> to <em>fib1</em>, so to set up the desired state of affairs, we
should initialize <em>i</em> to be <em>1</em>.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var i := 1;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can state and Dafny can verify a number of conditions that we
expect and require to hold at this point. First, <em>fib1</em> equals
<em>fib(i)</em>. Now to compute the next (<em>i+1st</em>) Fibonacci number, we need
not only the value of <em>fib(i)</em> but also <em>fib(i-1)</em>. We will thus also
want <em>fib0</em> to hold this value at the start and end of each loop
iteration, and indeed we do have that state of affairs right now.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert fib1 == fib(i);
assert fib0 == fib(i-1);
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To compute <em>fib(n)</em> for any <em>n</em> greater than or equal to <em>2</em> will
require at least one execution of the loop body. We’ll thus set our
loop condition to be <em>i &lt; n</em>. This ensures that the loop body will run
at least once, to compute <em>fib(2)</em>, as <em>i</em> is <em>1</em> and <em>n</em> is at least
<em>2</em>; so the loop condition <em>i &lt; n</em> is <em>true</em>, which dictates that the
loop body must be evaluated at least once.</p>
<p>Within the loop body we’ll compute <em>fib(i+1)</em> (we call it <em>fib2</em>
within the loop) by adding together <em>fib0</em> and <em>fib1</em>; then we
increment <em>i</em>; then we update <em>fib0</em> and <em>fib1</em> so that for the <em>new</em>
value of <em>i</em> they hold <em>fib(i-1)</em> and <em>fib(i)</em>. To do this we assign
the initial value of <em>fib1</em> to <em>fib0</em> and the value of <em>fib2</em> to
<em>fib1</em>.</p>
<p>Let’s work an example. Suppose <em>n</em> happens to be <em>2</em>. The loop body
will run, and after the one execution, <em>i</em> will have the value, <em>2</em>;
<em>fib1</em> will have the value of <em>fib(2)</em>, and <em>fib0</em> will have the value
of <em>fib(1)</em>. Because <em>i</em> is now <em>2</em> and <em>n</em> is still <em>2</em>, the loop
condition will now be false and the loop will terminate. The value of
<em>fib1</em> will of course be <em>fib(i)</em> but now we’ll also have that <em>i ==
n</em> (it takes a little reasoning to prove this), so <em>fib(i)</em> will be
<em>fib(n)</em>, which is the result we want and that we return.</p>
<p>We can also informally prove to ourself that this strategy gives us a
program that always terminates and returns a value. That is, it does
not go into an infinite loop. To see this, note that the value of <em>i</em>
is initally less than or equal to <em>n</em>, and it increases by only <em>1</em> on
each time through the loop. The value of <em>n</em> is finite, so the value
of <em>i</em> will eventually equal the value of <em>n</em> at which point the loop
condition will be falsified and the looping will end.</p>
<p>That’s our strategy. Here’s the while loop that we have designed. Now
for the first time, we see something crucial. In general, Dafny has no
idea how many times a loop body will execute. Intead, what it needs to
know are properties of the state of the program that hold no matter
how many times the loop executes, that, when combined with the fact
that the has terminated allows one to conclude that the loop does what
it’s meant to do. We call such properties <em>loop invariants</em>.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>while (i &lt; n)
    invariant i &lt;= n;
    invariant fib0 == fib(i-1);
    invariant fib1 == fib(i);
{
    var fib2 := fib0 + fib1;
    fib0 := fib1;
    fib1 := fib2;
    i := i + 1;
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The invariants are just the conditions that we required to hold for
our design of the loop to work. First, <em>i</em> must never exceed <em>n</em>. If
it did, the loop would spin off into infinity. Second, to compute the
next (the <em>i+1st)</em> Fibonacci number we have to have the previous <em>two</em>
in memory. So <em>fib0</em> better hold <em>fib(i-1)</em> and <em>fib1</em>, <em>fib(i)</em>. Note
that these conditions do not have to hold at all times <em>within</em> the
execution of the loop body, where things are being updated, but they
do have to hold before before and after each execution.</p>
<p>The body of the loop is just as we described it above. We can use our
minds to deduce that if the invariants hold before each loop body runs
(and they do), then they will also hold after it runs. We can also see
that after the loop terminates, it must be that <em>i==n</em>, because we
know that it’s always true that <em>i &lt;= n</em> and the loop condition must
now be false, which is to say that <em>i</em> can no longer be strictly less
than <em>n</em>, so <em>i</em> must now equal <em>n</em>. Logic says so.</p>
<p>What is amazing is that we can write these assertions in Dafny if we
wish to, and Dafny will verify that they are true statements about the
state of the program after the loop has run. We have <em>proved</em> (or
rather Dafny has proved and we have confirmed) that our loop always
computes the right answer. Dafny has also proved to itself that the
loop always terminates. We have a formal proof of total correctness
for this program.</p>
<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>assert i &lt;= n;      // invariant
assert !(i &lt; n);    // loop condition is false
assert (i &lt;= n) &amp;&amp; !(i &lt; n) ==&gt; (i == n);
assert i == n;      // deductive conclusion
assert fib1 == fib(i); // invariant
assert fib1 == fib(i) &amp;&amp; (i==n) ==&gt; fib1 == fib(n);
assert fib1 == fib(n);
return fib1;

<h2>What is Dafny, Again?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-dafny-again" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Dafny is a cutting-edge software language and tooset for verification
of imperative code. It was developed at Microsoft Research—one of
the top computer science research labs in the world. We are exploring
Dafny and the ideas underlying it in the first part of this course to
give a sense of why it’s vital for a computer scientist today to have
a substantial understanding of logic and proofs along with the ability
to <em>code</em>.</p>
<p>Tools such as TLA+, Dafny, and others of this variety give us a way
both to express formal specifications and imperative code in a unified
way (albeit in different sub-languages), and to have some automated
checking done in an attempt to verify that code satisfies its spec.</p>
<p>We say <em>attempt</em> here, because in general verifying the consistency of
code and a specification is a literally unsolvable problem. In cases
that arise in practice, much can often be done. It’s not always easy,
but if one requires ultra-high assurance of the consistency of code
and specification, then there is no choice but to employ the kinds of
<em>formal methods</em> introduced here.</p>
<p>To understand how to use such state-of-the-art software development
tools and methods, one must understand not only the language of code,
but also the languages of mathematical logic, including set and type
theory. One must also understand precisely what it means to <em>prove</em>
that a program satisfies its specification. And for that, one must
develop a sense for propositions and proofs: what they are and how
they are built and evaluated.</p>
<p>The well educated computer scientist and the professional software
engineer must understand logic and proofs as well as coding, and how
they work together to help build <em>trustworthy</em> systems. Herein lies
the deep relevance of logic and proofs, which might otherwise seem
like little more than abstract nonsense and a distraction from the
task of learning how to program.</p>
