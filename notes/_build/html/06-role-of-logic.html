<h1>6. Logic in Computer Science<a class="headerlink" href="#logic-in-computer-science" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Logic is the study of the nature, forms, and processes of <em>defensible</em>
reasoning. The central question is what propositions can we reasonably
accept as being true? In more detail, how can we reason from what we
already know or accept to be true to new propsitions, with reasonable
confidence that these will also be true.</p>
<p>Today we recognize that rigorous reasoning falls into two categories:
<em>inductive</em> and <em>deductive</em>. Inductive reasoning draws conclusions
(new propositions) by generalizing from examples (observations). The
sun’s come up every day so far, so it will come up again tomorrow.
The only swans we have ever seen are white, so there are no black
swans. These are examples of inductive reasoning.</p>
<p>Unless one had made all possible observations (seen the sun come up
every day for all eternity; seen every swan that ever was or will be),
then inductive reasoning is not <em>sound</em>: it is not <em>guaranteed</em> to
produce results that are <em>certain</em> to be true.</p>
<div class="section" id="inductive-reasoning">
<h2>Inductive Reasoning<a class="headerlink" href="#inductive-reasoning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Inductive reasoning is a form of reasoning where one draws conclusions
based on generalization from examples. The parable of the Black Swans
illustrates the concept well. Until 1697, Europeans had never seen a
black swan. They had only seen white swans. On the basis of these many
examples, they generally accepted as true a long-standing belief that
black swans simply do not exist. Their confidence in their conclusion
was so strong that <em>black swan</em> was commonly used as an idiom meaning
<em>an impossibility</em>.</p>
<p>Yet in that fateful year, 1697, Dutch explorers venturing to Western
Australia discovered the impossible: they were the first Europeans to
see with their own eyes a real black swan. The prior believe of all of
Europe in the non-existence of black swans was shattered by a single
observation.</p>
<p>Inductive reasoning can be extremely useful. It can lead to important
hypotheses backed by significant bodies of evidence. But this form of
reasoning not <em>sound</em>. No matter how many examples have been observed
(unless it is all of them), inductive reasoning can yield conclusions
that just aren’t true. Jonh Stuart Mill, paraphrasing David Hume, said
““No amount of observations of white swans can allow the inference
that all swans are white, but the observation of a single black swan
is sufficient to refute that conclusion.”</p>
<p>In the software development field, concluding that a system satisfies
its specification based on the results of <em>testing</em> the systen on some
but not all of its permitted inputs is a form of inductive reasoning.
The reasoning goes like this: We’ve done a whole bunch of testing and
we haven’t found a bug yet, so we’ll take it as true that the program
satsifies its specification.</p>
<p>Most software systems have more possible inputs that there are atoms
in the universe, so testing all possible inputs (<em>exhaustive</em> testing)
is usually infeasible in practice. One can only test most programs on
subsets of their permitted input values. Drawing conclusions about the
correctness of code in general on the basis of not yet having found an
input that causes an error is akin to concluding that there are no
black swans (bugs in code) because one has only ever seen white swans
(good behaviors) in practice.</p>
<p>Following Hume and Mill, the famous Dutch software theorist, Edsgar
Dijkstra (pronounced <em>DIKE-stra</em>), famously stated that, “Program
testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but
is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence.”</p>
<p>Much software is developed and used in practice without and kind of
precise, documented specification. Developing software intuitively is
often a practical, affordable, satisfying, and effective approach.  In
many situations, it’s unclear to anyone before the software starts to
be produced what exactly is needed; and there is often acceptable risk
in producing and using software developed in an intuitive, craft-like
manner.</p>
<p>Indeed, writing software, like writing novels or poems, is often an
exploration: you discover something wonderful by writing it, without a
real understanding of exactly how things will turn out. An experienced
carpenter can similarly build a beautiful house, often collaborating
with someone who needs that house, with little more than a broad plan
in mind, with <em>justifiable confidence</em> that issues that might arise
can be dealt with as things go along.</p>
<p>Software testing is often a practical, effective approach to producing
<em>good enough</em> software in this manner. In general it won’t prove the
absence of bugs in code, but it can provide acceptably strong evidence
in support of hypotheses (always with some risk of being proven wrong)
of suitability for use.</p>

<div class="section" id="deductive-reasoning">
<h2>Deductive Reasoning<a class="headerlink" href="#deductive-reasoning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The alternative to (often useful but) unsound inductive reasoning is
<em>deductive</em> reasoning. Deductive reasoning provides absolute assurance
of the truth of given conclusions, provided that the premises on which
the conclusions are based are valid.</p>
<p>The earliest surviving results in deductive logic are due to the Greek
philosopher, Aristotle. He formulated sound reasoning as employing
what he called <em>syllogisms</em>. These are rules that permit one to deduce
<em>conclusions</em> about what statements are true from <em>premises</em>, which
are statements that one has already accepted as true.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a syllogistic argment. Premise 1: All people are
mortal. Premise 2: Thomas Jefferson is a person. Conclusion: Thomas
Jefferson (TJ) is mortal. The reasoning is unassailable. There is no
remaining doubt. If the premises are true, then the conclusion <em>must</em>
be true as well. Deductive reasoning, unlike inductive reasoning, is
<em>sound</em>.</p>
<p>Aristotle’s logic was based on a catalog of such syllogisms. The one
that we just used is known as <em>modus ponens.</em> The schema for such an
argument is that if every <em>X</em> has a property <em>P</em> and <em>T</em> is an <em>X</em>
then <em>T</em>, in particular, must have property <em>P</em>.</p>
<p>Modern mathematical (or <em>symbolic</em>) logic was developed by 19th and
early 20th century philosophers including the American philosopher,
Charles Saunders Peirce (pronounced “purse”), Gottlieb von Frege,
George Boole, and others. It took from Aristotle a concern for sound
reasoning, while adopting rigorous notations of modern mathematics.</p>
<p>Here are two equivalent ways using modern notation that one might use
to formulate Aristotle’s syllogism as it relates to Thomas Jefferson.
Here’s one: <img class="math" src="_images/math/4fa4cb96eb538c4ad5deac9e030aa7366a327e46.png" alt="Person(x) \rightarrow Mortal(x), Mortal(TJ)
\sststile{}{} Mortal(TJ)"/>. This expression is called a <em>sequent</em>. It
has two parts separated by a <em>turnstile</em>, <img class="math" src="_images/math/a0f07647dfacd0dee79cf52c3cdd3d71e6391e62.png" alt="\sststile{}{}"/>. To
the left of the turnstile is a list of premises. To the right is a
conclusion.  The first premise, an <em>implication</em>, can be read as
saying “x being a person <em>implies</em> that x is mortal,” or, in a more
natural manner of speaking, “if x is a person then x is mortal.” The
second premise can be read as “TJ is a person.”  The conclusion then
states, “TJ is mortal.”</p>
<p>Sometimes a vertical rather than a horizonal notation is used to say
the same thing.</p>
<div class="math">
<p><img src="_images/math/6e68b7a4f7c54681ff37db0e6f512a6a19067107.png" alt="\begin{displaymath}
  \prftree[r]{${\rightarrow}_{elim}$}
     {\prfassumption{Person(x) \rightarrow Mortal(x)}}
    {\prfassumption{Person(TJ)}}
    {Mortal(TJ)}
\end{displaymath}"/></p>
</div><p>In this rendering of the very same sequent, the premises are written
above the line, and the conclusion below. To the right of the sequent,
we’ve added an annotation, <img class="math" src="_images/math/2074b0d84ac720d7d8761c2ed65d83b7251e85f4.png" alt="{\rightarrow}_{elim}"/>, to document
which <em>rule of inference</em> we have used to deduce the conclusion from
the premises. In this case the rule we;ve used is called <em>implication
elimination</em>. This rule formalizes <em>modus ponens</em>. If <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> are
any propositions, and if we accept as premises that <em>if P is true then
Q is true</em> and that <em>P is true</em> then the <img class="math" src="_images/math/2074b0d84ac720d7d8761c2ed65d83b7251e85f4.png" alt="{\rightarrow}_{elim}"/>
rule allows us to conclude that <em>Q</em> must be true. We can write the
rule in a general form like this, where <em>P</em> and <em>Q</em> here stand for
<em>any</em> propositions.</p>
<div class="math">
<p><img src="_images/math/9b28c785dc074b361ba3879d53d3d18ee3bc27bb.png" alt="\begin{displaymath}
  \prftree[r]{${\rightarrow}_{elim}$}
     {\prfassumption{P \rightarrow Q}}
    {\prfassumption{P}}
    {Q}
\end{displaymath}"/></p>
</div><p>Deductive reasoning, then, is based on the use of <em>inference rules</em> to
move from sets of premises that are accepted as true to conclusions
that <em>must</em> therefore be true. Deduction removes all doubt about the
truth of conclusions. If given premises are true and sound inference
rules are used then conclusions deduced from the premises <em>must</em> be
true. If for example we accept as true that all people are mortal and
that Thomas Jefferson is a person, then there can be no remaining
doubt that Thomas Jefferson is also mortal.</p>
<p>Both inductive and deductive reasoning play vital roles in science and
engineering, in general, in computer science, more specifically, and
in software development, in particular. A major question in software
development is whether a program correctly implements a specification.
To conclude that it does based on observations of currect behavior
when it is testing on some but not all possible inputs is a kind of
inductive reasoning. One moves from limited observations (no bugs seen
so far) to broader conclusion (no bugs) by generalizing from limited
observations.  However, any such conclusion leaves considerable room
for doubt. Maybe not <em>all</em> bugs have been found, after all.  Drawing
conclusions based on the results of software testing is thus also said
to be <em>unsound</em>.</p>
<p>By contrast, constructing a mathematical <em>proof</em> that a program
behaves as specified for all possible inputs uses deductive reasoning
to remove any remaining doubt.  Things can still go wrong, such as the
hardware on which software runs being faulty, or the proof being
wrong, but as long as such a proof it good, then any remaining doubt
is eliminated entirely.</p>
<p><em>Formal verification</em> is the term that describes the use of deductive
logic, and in particular the construction of proofs of propositions
that <em>programs behave as specified</em>. Formal verification is used in
cases where very high levels of justificable confidence in the correct
operation of software is required. It is thus vital to the engineering
of software for life-critical medical devices, nuclear weapons, power
plants, financial systems, and critical infrastructure, e.g., for air
traffic control, flight avionics, and automated vechicles. The formal
verfication of software can, and increasingly does, play a vital role
in many sectors of the economy. <em>Proofs</em> of key propositions about the
behaviors of programs are a gold standard for high levels of assurance
of the fitness of software for intended uses.</p>
<p>Deductive logic and proof techniques are even more broadly important
in computer science. Develoeprs of new algorithms formulate and prove
propositions about their runtime and memory use (“space”) complexity.
Cryptologists formulate and prove security properties of methods for
protecting sensitive information. Networking researchers prove that
communication protocols never lose information without providing an
alert. People who develop the software that runs major data centers
(underpinning such services as Amazon, Google, and Netflix) formuate
and prove properties about the protocols used to maintain consistent
copies of data across multiple data centers, as a safeguard against
loss of information due natural disasters, human error, or malicious
attacks.</p>
<p>To understand formal verification, and thus to understand the state of
the art in software development, and to gain fluency in the science of
computer science more generally, genuinely requires an understanding
of mathematical logic and proofs. This course provides an introduction
to these topics using formal specification and verification as one of
several areas in computer science where these ideas have important
applications.</p>
<p>So far in this course you have seen how mathematical logic can be used
to write formal specifications of the required behaviors of programs
and to verify that programs exhibit such behaviors for <em>all</em> possible
inputs. The big example we’ve developed so far is a formally specified
and verified program to efficiently compute fibonacci numbers. We’ve
also seen how an automated verification tool (Dafny), which is based
on deductive logic and proof techniques, can formally verify software
by generating <em>proofs</em> that you as a programmer often never even see.</p>
<p>While both inductive and deductive reasoning play important roles in
computer science, it is deductive reasoning that that is most widely
employed across the field. That is because we often want to be <em>sure</em>
about properties of programs, algorithms, protocols, kids of problems,
and so forth.</p>
<p>We hope that the course so far has helped you see that deductive logic
and proof techniques are deeply important in computer science and in
software development, in particular. More than academic abstractions,
they really are vital tools of the trade. Indeed, so central are logic
and proofs to computer science that logic has been called the calculus
of computer science. That it, logic plays a role in computer science
akin to that of the calculus in engineering and the natural sciences.</p>
<p>So with formal specification and verification of efficient, imperative
programs as motivating example now <em>in the bag</em>, it’s time to start to
<em>open the black box</em> and to see in more detail what it means to be a
logic, a proposition, an interpretation, an inference rule, a proof.</p>
<p>The question of what ways of reasoning are defensible, rather than
<em>fallacious</em>, has been explored for millenia.</p>
<p>The early Greek
philosopher, Aristotle, is generally credited with having developed
one of the first rigorous accounts of logically defensible reasoning.</p>
<p>uses deductive reasoning, based on
the construction of mathematical <em>proofs</em> that a program behaves as
specified for all possible inputs, even when there might be an
astronomical or even infinite number of possible inputs.</p>

<p>Dafny supports a range of abstract data types akin to those found in
widely used, industrial imperative programming languages and systems,
such as Python and Java. In this chapter, we introduce and briefly
illustrate the use of these types. The types we discuss are as follow:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>bool, supporting Boolean algebra</li>
<li>int, nat, and real types, supporting <em>exact</em> arithmetic (unlike
the numerical types found in most industrial languages</li>
<li>char, supporting character types</li>
<li>set&lt;T&gt; and iset&lt;T&gt;, polymorphic set theory for finite and infinite sets</li>
<li>seq&lt;T&gt; and iseq&lt;T&gt;, polymorphic finite and infinite sequences</li>
<li>string, supporting character sequences (with addtional helpful functions)</li>
<li>map&lt;K,V&gt; and imap&lt;K,V&gt;, polymorphic finite and infinite partial functions</li>
<li>array&lt;T&gt;, polymorphic 1- and multi-dimensional arrays</li>

<p>The bool abstract data type (ADT) in Dafny provides a bool data type
with values, <em>true</em> and <em>false</em>, along with the Boolean operators that
are supported by most programming langauges, along with a few that are
not commonly supported by industrial programming languages and
systems.</p>
<p>Here’s a method that computes nothing useful and returns no values,
but that illustrates the range of Boolean operators in Dafny. We also
use the examples in this chapter to discuss a few other aspects of the
Dafny language.</p>

<p>Dafny also supports polymorphic maps, both finite (map&lt;K,V&gt;) and
infinite (imap&lt;K,V&gt;).  The key type, K, must support equality (==).
In mathematical terms, a map really represents a binary relation,
i.e., a set of &lt;K,V&gt; pairs, which is to say a subset of the product
set, K * V, where we view the types K and V as defining sets of
values.</p>

<div class="section" id="arrays">
<h2>Arrays<a class="headerlink" href="#arrays" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<div class="highlight-dafny"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>method ArrayPlay()
{
    var a := new int[10]; // in general: a: array&lt;T&gt; := new T[n];

}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Arrays, objects (class instances), and traits (to be discussed) are of
“reference” types, which is to say, values of these types are stored
on the heap. Values of other types, including sets and sequences, are
of “value types,” which is to say values of these types are stored on
the stack; and they’re thus always treated as “local” variables. They
are passed by value, not reference, when passed as arguments to
functions and methods. Value types include the basic scalar types
(bool, char, nat, int, real), built-in collection types (set,
multiset, seq, string, map, imap), tuple, inductive, and co-inductive
types (to be discussed).  Reference type values are allocated
dynamically on the heap, are passed by reference, and therefore can be
“side effected” (mofified) by methods to which they are passed.</p>
